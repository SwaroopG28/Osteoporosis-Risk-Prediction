# Osteoporosis Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of osteoporosis based on a range of patient data inputs. The model is built to assist in the early detection of osteoporosis, helping healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and initiate preventive measures. This can improve patient outcomes by targeting those in need of lifestyle interventions or medical evaluations.

Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes variables such as age, gender, lifestyle habits, and other health metrics to provide a risk assessment for osteoporosis. This tool is valuable for healthcare applications, particularly in aiding early detection and enhancing preventive care efforts.
